                <strong>SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES.</strong> We are dedicated to enhancing public safety and
                reducing the fear and the incidence of crime. People in our communities are our most
                important customers. Our motto “To Protect and to Serve” is not just a slogan - it is our
                way of life. We will work in partnership with the people in our communities and do our best,
                within the law, to solve community problems that affect public safety. We value the great
                diversity of people in both our residential and business communities and serve all with equal
                dedication.<br><br>
        
                <strong>REVERENCE FOR THE LAW.</strong> We have been given the honor and privilege of enforcing
                the law. We must always exercise integrity in the use of the power and authority that have
                been given to us by the people. Our personal and professional behavior should be a model for
                all to follow. We will obey and support the letter and the spirit of the Law.<br><br>
        
                <strong>COMMITMENT TO LEADERSHIP.</strong> We believe the Los Angeles Police Department should
                be a leader in Law Enforcement. We also believe that each individual needs to be a leader in
                his or her area of responsibility. Making sure that our values become part of our day-to-day
                work life is our mandate. We must each work to ensure that our co-workers, our professional
                colleagues and our communities have the highest respect for the Los Angeles Police
                Department.<br><br>
        
                <strong>INTEGRITY IN ALL WE SAY AND DO.</strong> Integrity is our standard. We are proud of our
                profession and will conduct ourselves in a manner that merits the respect of all people. We
                will demonstrate honest, ethical behavior in all our interactions. Our actions will match our
                words. We must have the courage to stand up for our beliefs and do what is right. Throughout
                the ranks, the Los Angeles Police Department has a long history of integrity and freedom
                from corruption. Upholding this proud tradition is a challenge we must all continue to meet.<br><br>
        
                <strong>RESPECT FOR PEOPLE.</strong> Working with the Los Angeles Police Department should be
                challenging and rewarding. Our people are our most important resource. We can best serve
                the many and varied needs of our communities by empowering our employees to fulfill their
                responsibilities with knowledge, authority and appropriate discretion. We encourage our
                people to submit ideas, we listen to their suggestions, and we help them develop to their
                maximum potential. We believe in treating all people with respect and dignity. We show
                concern and empathy for the victims of crime and treat violators of the law with fairness
                and dignity. By demonstrating respect for others, we will earn respect for the Los Angeles
                Police Department.<br><br>
        
                <strong>QUALITY THROUGH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.</strong> We will strive to achieve the
                highest level of quality in all aspects of our work. We can never be satisfied with the “status
                quo”. We must aim for continuous improvement in serving the people in our communities.
                We value innovation and support creativity. We realize that constant change is a way of life
                in a dynamic city like Los Angeles, and we dedicate ourselves to proactively seeking new and
                better ways to serve.<br><br>
