                        Although handwritten documents may still be
                        acceptable, most are submitted via an
                        electronic, or "E-document", typed on a
                        computer or word processor.

                        <br><br>
                        Once a document has been submitted via
                        chain of command, it is "memorialized" and
                        becomes a historical document. Additional
                        information obtained after the initial
                        Follow-Up Investigation, Form 03.14.00, has
                        been submitted, must be documented on a
                        new 03.14.00 as a Supplemental
                        Investigation. The additional information
                        must not be added to an "E-document" that
                        has previously been submitted and routed
                        through chain of command. The
                        Supplemental document must stand on it's
                        own.
